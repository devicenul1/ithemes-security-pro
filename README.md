# ithemes-security-pro

This repo is to hold the Professional version of the [iThemes Security Pro plugin](https://solidwp.com/security/)

## Updating

The ithemes-security-pro plugin is not publically available and is instead behind a paywall.
To update this plugin you will need to login to the ithemes-security-pro website, download the latest version and replace all the files in the `src` directory with the new version.

### Potential Improvement

- Starting a support ticket with the ithemes-security-pro company to ensure our assumption of public consumption of the plugin files is correct.
- Adding to an issue or statement to an in-band process for the ithemes-security-pro team to evaluate making the pro version of the plugin available publicly for automation.

## Build and Release

- Add new version files into src directory
- Uptick `version.txt` file to match the new version number of the plugin
- Push to main
